# RadioModulator
A tool to quickly convert raw dialog audio files into trimmed radio transmissions.

This is a small C# WinForms app that can take in an MP3 or WAV file of raw recorded dialogue.  It will then display the waveform, allowing you to choose the start and end of where it should trim.  Next, choose a radio quality from four presets and click "Export".

Also has some extra options to add the static "kssh" sound at the beginning and end, and to normalize the volume of the input clip.
